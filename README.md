**___Note: This repo is similar to my other [project collection repo](https://github.com/enescavus/Data-Science-Projects) but in this one I will be uploading my algorithm based solutions with various hyperparameters for each model that I trained and deployed. Also you can find statistical approaches for different datasets/data types.___**

### Up-Coming Notebooks - Working On 
    
    - Decision Trees with hyperparameter tuning - Forests - Bagging(Bootstrap-Aggregation)
    - [DONE], Understanding Chi-Square & Cramer's V Test with Random Forest Feature Importance parameter (Visualized)
    - Clustering with Kmeans- DBSCAN and other optional algorithms may include
    - PCA ( dimensional reduction ) understanding
    - More EDA and Advenced Visualizations with seaborn (2D - 3D)
    ...

## Applied Statistics (Chi-Squared & Cramer's V) + EDA + ML Notebook w/ Income Data 

This notebook includes statistical analysis on categorical values. It is created for understanding categorical to categorical
data relationships. 

And also I compared statistical outputs with a machine learning algorithms feature importance function.

[Data - chi-squared-cramer-v-adultIncome](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income)

### Possible Further works for Graduation Data
    - Testing more Linear Algorithms
    - More fine-tuning and optimizations
    - Curve analysis
    
### Possible Further works for Income Data
    - Apply different imputition methods
    - Focus on ML instead EDA - overwrite
    - Use statistical results to choose features
    - Add other classification algorithms for ensembling
